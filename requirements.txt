🔐 DL Password Vault — Dependency Overview

This document provides an overview of all Python dependencies used in DL Password Vault, explaining their purpose and how each one contributes to the application's functionality.

🧩 Core Dependencies
Package	Purpose	Usage in the App
cryptography	Provides strong encryption algorithms, including Fernet (AES-based symmetric encryption).	Encrypts and decrypts stored passwords using a locally generated key (key.key).
openai	Integrates OpenAI’s GPT model to generate strong, random passwords and potentially future AI-assisted security features.	Used for AI password generation in the “Generate Password (AI)” feature.
zxcvbn	Evaluates password strength based on patterns, length, and character variety.	Provides a strength meter and helps users create more secure passwords.
pyttsx3	Text-to-speech engine that works offline.	Powers the optional voice feedback in the UI for accessibility and enhanced user experience.
Pillow (PIL)	Image processing library for Python.	Used to display and resize images (like the app logo) in the Tkinter interface.
🧰 Standard Library Modules (No Installation Needed)

These come with Python by default — they are included here for reference but do not need to be listed in requirements.txt:

Module	Function
tkinter	Builds the graphical user interface (buttons, labels, text fields).
os, json	File system and data serialization.
hashlib	Hashes master passwords securely.
random, string	Generates fallback passwords if OpenAI is unavailable.
csv	Optional export/import capability for password data.
⚙️ Optional Add-Ons (Not Required but Useful)
Package	Description	Why You Might Add It
python-dotenv	Manages environment variables from a .env file.	Recommended for securely storing your OpenAI API key instead of hard-coding it.
requests	Handles HTTP requests easily.	Useful if you expand the app to include remote syncing or online services.
